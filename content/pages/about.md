I'm a 22-year-old with a burning desire to make our world better. Over the years, I've closely followed and contributed to the development of multiple FOSS projects and along the way, I've picked up the intuition for using tools throughout the tech stack - from hardware setup to SQL to GraphQL to HTML!

I've recently begun exploring the machine learning. I find the way it uncovers the stories hidden in data intriguing. I'm especially drawn towards Affective Computing and how it ties to mental health.

I believe that learning is a continuous and practical part of life and I'm constantly putting myself in situations that require to learn and improvise - whether it's within tech, business or life in general.
